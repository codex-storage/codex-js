# Download example

Small example to show how to download a file in the browser with Codex.

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Build the javascript asset

```bash
CODEX_CID=REPLACE_BY_YOUR_CID npm run build
```

The response will be displayed as text, so it is better to test with .txt files.

Note: You can define `CODEX_NODE_URL`, default value is "http://localhost:8080".

## Check the results

Open the index.html and open the web console.
